# AppLovin MAX SDK

## Overview
MAX is AppLovin's in-app monetization solution.

Move beyond the traditional monetization solution and integrate MAX. MAX is a single unbiased auction where advertisers get equal access to all ad inventory and bid simultaneously, which drives more competition and higher CPMs for you. You can read more about it [here](https://www.applovin.com/max-header-bidding).

Please check out our [documentation](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/android/getting-started) to get started on integrating and enabling mediated networks using our guides.

## Demo Apps
To get started with the demo apps, follow the instructions below:

1. Open your desired project in Android Studio: `DemoApp-Java` or `DemoApp-Kotlin`.
2. Verify that the dependency `implementation 'com.applovin:applovin-sdk:+'` is included in your `build.gradle (Module: app)`.
3. Update the `applovin.sdk.key` value in `AndroidManifest.xml` file with your AppLovin SDK key associated with your account.
4. Update the package with your own unique identifier associated with the application you will create (or already created, if it is an existing app) in the MAX dashboard.
5. Update the unique MAX ad unit id value within each ad's activity code. Each ad format will correspond to a unique MAX ad unit ID you created in the AppLovin dashboard for the package used before.
